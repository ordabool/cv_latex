%---------------------------------------------------------
I'm a software enthusiast at heart, always on the look for the next thing to learn. Currently working as a web developer while pursuing my BSc degree in computer science.

During my studies, I was introduced to subjects in Computer Science that I never encountered as a web developer. I found a new passion in low-level software development and I would like to challenge myself in that field.

I'm hard-working, constantly striving for the best, and always up for a challenge.
I'm looking for a great work environment, being surrounded by colleagues who push and elevate each other and the common goals.
